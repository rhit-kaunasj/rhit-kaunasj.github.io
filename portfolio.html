                    <h2>Processor Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over Fall of 2023 I worked with a team of three other students to create an orignial assembly language and the associated processor. This
                        began by creating the instructions needed to execute a baseline program to find the relative primes of a given number. Once done we
                        implemented our processor using Verilog and gathered data on the performance of our processor based on the relative primes algorithm. Along 
                        the way we created and maintained documentation about our design process to allow for anyone to learn how to use our language and processor 
                        when they only have the documentation.

                    <h2>2-Dimensional Pong</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over Winter of 2022-2023 I worked with a partner to implement a 2D version of Pong on an Altera DE2 FPGA Board. We first had to create basic
                        digital logic constructions from scratch, and then connect them into a working game. This included registers, multiplexors, and a Finite 
                        State Machine for our Control. Once finished the game kept track of the points of each player and displayed messages based on if there was
                        a new game or if the game was over.
